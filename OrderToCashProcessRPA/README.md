# Robotic Process Automation (RPA): Automating Invoicing for a Fictional Client

This project simulates a real-world consulting scenario where I act as a **Robotic Process Automation (RPA) consultant** hired by **Bolt Socks**, a **fictional wholesale sock supplier**, to streamline their **Order-to-Cash (O2C)** process. The focus was to **analyze inefficiencies** using process mining and build an **automated invoicing solution** using **UiPath**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Bolt Socks was facing delays in generating invoices after confirming deliveries, leading to **cash flow issues**. The simulated goal was to:

- **Visualize the current process** using **Lucidchart**
- **Identify inefficiencies** using **Celonis Process Mining**
- **Automate invoice generation** using **UiPath Studio**

The automation focused on reducing the **manual lag between delivery and invoicing**, ultimately accelerating the order-to-cash cycle.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Lucidchart** – for process mapping  
- **Celonis Snap** – for process mining  
- **UiPath Studio** – for robotic process automation  
- **Microsoft Outlook 365 + Excel + Word** – for email handling and invoice creation

## 👤 My Role

As the sole consultant, I led this project **end-to-end**:

1. **Mapped** the as-is O2C workflow from interview transcripts using Lucidchart  
2. **Mined and analyzed** the process using real event logs in Celonis  
3. **Developed** an RPA solution using UiPath Studio to generate and email invoices  
4. **Presented** a summary report and visuals to explain findings and automation outcomes

## 🤖 UiPath Automation Workflow

The automated bot scans Outlook for delivery confirmation emails, matches them to the orders list, and creates & emails personalized invoices. Steps include:

- Extracting dynamic fields like date, due date, and amount
- Filling a **Word template**
- Saving invoices as PDFs
- Sending them via **Outlook**
- Moving processed emails to an "RPA" folder
